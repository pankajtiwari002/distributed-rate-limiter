# Distributed Rate Limiter (Go + Redis + Lua)

A **production-grade distributed rate limiter** built in Go using **Redis Lua scripts** for atomic enforcement across multiple API instances.  
The system supports **per-endpoint rate limits**, **fail-open / fail-closed modes**, and **observability via metrics**.

---

## Why This Project?

Rate limiting is a core backend infrastructure problem.  
This project demonstrates how real-world systems handle:

- Concurrency at scale
- Atomic state updates
- Distributed consistency
- Fault tolerance
- Config-driven behavior
- Observability

This is **not** an in-memory or single-node limiter — it is **distributed and production-ready**.

---

## High-Level Design

- **Algorithm:** Token Bucket  
- **State Store:** Redis  
- **Concurrency Control:** Redis Lua (atomic execution)  
- **Language:** Go  
- **Deployment:** Local + Docker (Windows friendly)

### Request Flow

1. Client sends request
2. Rate-limit middleware intercepts request
3. Middleware builds `(client_id + endpoint)` key
4. Go service calls Redis Lua script
5. Lua atomically refills and consumes tokens
6. Redis returns allow / block decision
7. Request proceeds or returns `429 Too Many Requests`
